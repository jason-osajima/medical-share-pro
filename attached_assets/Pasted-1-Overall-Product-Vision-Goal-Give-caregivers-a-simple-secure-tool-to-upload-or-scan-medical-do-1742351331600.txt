4. Design & Interaction Guidelines
Simplicity for Caregivers

Large font sizes (16–18px+).
High-contrast text and icons.
Minimal number of steps in flows.
Calming, Approachable Colors

Light backgrounds, moderate accent color (e.g., muted blues/greens).
Avoid clinical white-on-white or overly sterile designs. A bit of warmth is welcome.
Mobile-Responsive Layout

On phones, single-column flow, big “+” button for scanning and adding appointments.
On desktop, more space for a grid-based view of categories and timeline.
Security Messaging

Basic reassurance about encryption and data privacy.
Highlight that your app does not connect to official medical systems.
Clear disclaimers that this is user-managed data storage, not a HIPAA “patient portal.”
5. Technical Feasibility & Timeline
Stack Options

Low-Code: Tools like Bubble or Adalo for rapid prototyping.
Custom: A React (or Vue) front end with Node.js/Express or Django backend.
Database: Simple relational schema (appointments, documents, tags, user accounts).
Storage: Secure cloud (AWS S3 or similar) with encryption at rest.
MVP Delivery (~2–3 months)

Basic timeline listing.
Month 2
Polishing flows: attach docs to appointments, robust search.
Sharing or partial OCR if feasible.
Finalize mobile responsiveness & security layer.
Month 3

6. Why This MVP Solves Caregiver Pain Points
Document Chaos
Caregivers can upload or scan quickly, tag docs, and later find them via categories, tags, or appointments.
Appointment Tracking
Timeline ensures each visit’s outcome is captured, with relevant docs attached in a chronological log.
Low Tech Barrier
Large, clear UI; no forced integration with hospital systems.
Straightforward steps keep it accessible for older or less tech-savvy users.
Quick Retrieval
Global search bar, timeline, and category filters make it simple to find the right record.
Security & Privacy
Caregiver-managed data. No strict HIPAA overhead since it’s an organizing tool, but still uses encryption.
Optional sharing means the user decides exactly what’s shared and for how long.
